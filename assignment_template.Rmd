## QUESTION 2: Data Pipeline

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

The palmerpenguins dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica. Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap penguins are the three extant members of the Pygoscelis genus, also known as Brush-tail penguins. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggest that the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago. Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins comprise a sister group, as Adelie penguins diverged from other members of the genus around 19 million years ago [3].

Penguins are flightless birds, with wings morphed by evolution into flippers, used to propel themselves underwater. It is reasonable to assume that larger penguins require larger flippers in order to create more powerful swimming strokes. This study aims to evidence this proposed association between body mass and flipper length.

Adelie penguins are a sexually dimorphic species, with adult males averaging larger than adult females in mass (~11%) and flipper length (~3%) [4]. As the male and female phenotype differs, it is possible that the strength of relationship between body mass and flipper length also differs between the sexes. An additional aim of this study is to test for a difference in correlation of these two variables, between male and female penguins.

The exploratory plot above reveals two noteworthy trends:

- There appears to be a linear correlation between body mass and flipper length.

- The distributions of both variables appear to differ between the sexes.


### Hypotheses

1st hypothesis:
There is a significant positive correlation between the body mass and flipper length of Adelie penguins.

2nd hypothesis:
The difference between correlation coefficients for male and female penguins is significant.


### Statistical Methods

Linear regression model:

A linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between body mass and flipper length. Body mass was treated as the independent variable, to quantify the extent to which variation in flipper length is explained by variation in body mass. The p-value produced by the linear model was compared to a significance level of 0.05.

Package used - Base R statistics


Step 2 - Fisher's Z-test

Fisher's Z-test was used to test whether the difference between correlation coefficients for each sex was significant. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated separately for males and females. The correlation coefficients were transformed into z-scores using the Fisher transformation. The transformed values approximately follow a normal distribution, making the comparison more appropriate for statistical testing. The test statistic was calculated from the z-scores, providing a standardized measure of the difference between correlation coefficients. Finally, the p-value was calculated and compared to a significance level of 0.05.

### Results & Discussion

The results of the linear regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between body mass and flipper length for Adelie penguins (p < 0.05). This result therefore supports the 1st hypothesis.

An R-squared value of 0.2106 suggests that approximately 21.06% of variance in flipper length can be explained by changes in body mass. Therefore, although changes in body mass explain a significant proportion of the variance in flipper length, there are other factors contributing to this variation.

In addition to the linear regression analysis, Fisher's z-test was employed to assess whether the difference between correlation coefficients for males and females was significant. A p-value of 0.522 indicates that this is not the case, and so the 2nd hypothesis was rejected.

### Conclusion

To conclude, this study has provided convincing evidence to support the notion that body mass and flipper length are positively correlated in Adelie penguins. This relationship likely extends beyond the focal species of this study, and so wider conclusions about penguin physiology can be made with further research.

The sex-specific analysis of this relationship revealed that the strength of the correlation between these two variables is equal for males and females. This provides evidence to suggest that sexual dimorphisms do not impact the ratio of body mass to flipper length.
