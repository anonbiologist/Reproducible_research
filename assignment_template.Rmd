*Create a figure using the Palmer Penguin dataset that is correct but badly communicates the data. **Do not make a boxplot**.*

*Use the following references to guide you:*

-   [*https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a*](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a){.uri}

*Note: Focus on visual elements rather than writing misleading text on it.*

### a) Provide your figure here:

```{r bad figure code, echo=FALSE}

# Install packages:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "palmerpenguins", "janitor", "dplyr"))

# Load the packages:
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)

# Look at the table with the raw data
head(penguins_raw)

# Export data from the palmerpenguins package
write.csv(penguins_raw, "data/penguins_raw.csv")

# Load data from working directory
penguins_raw <- read.csv("data/penguins_raw.csv")

# Define Function for cleaning
clean_function <- function(penguins_data) {
    penguins_data %>%
        select(-starts_with("Delta")) %>%
        select(-Comments) %>%
        clean_names()
}

# Call Function
penguins_clean <- clean_function(penguins_raw)

# Check the column names in the new data frame
names(penguins_clean)

# filter the data
body_mass_clean <- penguins_clean %>%
  select(body_mass_g, flipper_length_mm, species, sex) %>%
  na.omit()

# Create the bad graph 
(bodymass_scatterplot <- ggplot(data = body_mass_clean, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, aes(fill = sex)) +
    ylab("body mass") +
    xlab("flipper length") +
    ylim(c(0, 7000)) +
    xlim(c(0, 240))
)

# There is no need to provide the code for your bad figure, just use echo=FALSE so the code is hidden. Make sure your figure is visible after you knit it. 

```

### b) Write about how your design choices mislead the reader about the underlying data (200-300 words).

The intention of this figure is to illustrate the relationship between body mass and flipper size across three Brush-tailed penguin species. However, there are several issues with the design of the plot that make the relationship difficult to interpret. The graph lacks a title and so the reader cannot discern whether it represents a correlation analysis or a linear regression analysis. A correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship, whereas a linear regression analysis measures the effect of an independent variable upon a dependent variable, and so the two must be distinguished [1]. The current arrangement of axes may suggest to the reader that flipper size is the explanatory variable, however, this is not necessarily the case. The labels lack units and therefore the numerical scales for both variables are arbitrary, preventing the reader from conceptualizing the data. The scales themselves extend beyond what is needed to fully encapsulate the distributions of both variables, and hence the results are densely clustered. This is spatially inefficient, and does not illustrate the spread of the data to the reader, which in turn makes the nature of the relationship more difficult to interpret. The formatting of data points is problematic, as their size is too large to distinguish between individual points, which again prevents the reader from observing the spread of data [2]. As well as this, there is no colour differentiation between male and female data points, which renders the legend useless, and prevents the reader from observing any sexual dimorphisms in these two physiological traits. There is also no way of deciphering what species a data point belongs to, and this omits potentially important interspecific variation. Finally, a trend line could have been added to suggest a pattern in the data to the reader before beginning hypothesis testing.

### Introduction

The palmerpenguins dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica. Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap penguins are the three extant members of the Pygoscelis genus, also known as Brush-tail penguins. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggest that the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago. Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins comprise a sister group, as Adelie penguins diverged from other members of the genus around 19 million years ago [3].

Penguins are flightless birds, with wings morphed by evolution into flippers, used to propel themselves underwater. It is reasonable to assume that larger penguins require larger flippers in order to create more powerful swimming strokes. This study aims to evidence this proposed association between body mass and flipper length.

Adelie penguins are a sexually dimorphic species, with adult males averaging larger than adult females in mass (~11%) and flipper length (~3%) [4]. As the male and female phenotype differs, it is possible that the strength of relationship between body mass and flipper length also differs between the sexes. An additional aim of this study is to test for a difference in correlation of these two variables, between male and female penguins.

The exploratory plot above reveals two noteworthy trends:
1) There appears to be a linear correlation between body mass and flipper length.
2) The distributions of both variables appear to differ between the sexes.


### Hypotheses

1st:
There is a significant positive correlation between the body mass and flipper length of Adelie penguins.

2nd:
The difference between correlation coefficients for male and female penguins is significant.


### Statistical Methods

Linear regression model:

A linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between body mass and flipper length. Body mass was treated as the independent variable, to quantify the extent to which variation in flipper length is explained by variation in body mass. The p-value produced by the linear model was compared to a signficance level of 0.05.

Package used - Base R statistics


Step 2 - Fisher's Z-test

Fisher's Z-test was used to test whether the difference between correlation coefficients for each sex was significant. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated separately for males and females. The correlation coefficients were transformed into z-scores using the Fisher transformation. The transformed values approximately follow a normal distribution, making the comparison more appropriate for statistical testing. The test statistic was calculated from the z-scores, providing a standardized measure of the difference between correlation coefficients. Finally, the p-value was calculated and compared to a significance level of 0.05.

### Results & Discussion

The results of the linear regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between body mass and flipper length for Adelie penguins (p < 0.05). This result therefore supports the 1st hypothesis.

An R-squared value of 0.2106 suggests that approximately 21.06% of variance in flipper length can be explained by changes in body mass. Therefore, although changes in body mass explain a significant proportion of the variance in flipper length, there are other factors contributing to this variation.

In addition to the linear regression analysis, Fisher's z-test was employed to assess whether the difference between correlation coefficients for males and females was significant. A p-value of 0.522 indicates that this is not the case, and so the 2nd hypothesis was rejected.

### Conclusion

To conclude, this study has provided convincing evidence to support the notion that body mass and flipper length are positively correlated in Adelie penguins. This relationship likely extends beyond the focal species of this study, and so wider conclusions about penguin physiology can be made with further research.

The sex-specific analysis of this relationship revealed that the strength of the correlation between these two variables is equal for males and females. This provides evidence to suggest that sexual dimorphisms do not impact the ratio of body mass to flipper length.
